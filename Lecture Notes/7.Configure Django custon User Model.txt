-Lecture 16
Normalize email Addresses
-Its important to normalize the email address because the second part of email address is case insensitive i.e @gmail.com should not be 
case sensitive so should not be case sensitive when user logs into the system.
-We need to automatically make last part of email lower case everytime a new user registers.
-So we add this feature to our create_user function.
-1st implement the test model
-2nd we need to wrap the email in the models.py with the normalize email function.
-Run the test again

Lecture 17
Add Validation for Email Field
-Add validation to ensure email field is being provided when create_user function is called.
-1st open up tests.
-Here we want incase the user doesnot enter an email address, we raise a value error
-Implement the feature in our models

Lecture 18
Add Support for Creating superusers
-This is a function used by django CLI when creating new user
-Implement a test to check whether user is created and and assigned is_staff and is_superuser.
-SuperUser is part of PermissionsMixin
